Wednesday will greet you based on the time of day and wait for your commands. Try saying:

- "Search Wikipedia for artificial intelligence"
- "Open Facebook"
- "Take a screenshot"
- "What's the time?"
- "How much battery is left?"

To exit, say "shut down", "exit", or "sleep".

## Customization

I've designed Wednesday to be easily expandable. You can add new functionalities by modifying the `executeTask` function in the code.

## Challenges I Faced

While building Wednesday, I encountered a few challenges:
1. Ensuring accurate voice recognition in different environments
2. Managing multiple dependencies and their versions
3. Implementing error handling for various scenarios

## Future Improvements

I'm planning to add more features to Wednesday, including:
- Integration with smart home devices
- Natural language processing for more complex commands
- A graphical user interface
